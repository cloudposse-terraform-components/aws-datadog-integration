description: |-
  This component is responsible for provisioning Datadog AWS integrations. It depends on the `datadog-configuration`
  component to get the Datadog API keys.

  See Datadog's [documentation about provisioning keys](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys) for
  more information.

  This project is supported by the [Datadog Open Source Program](https://www.datadoghq.com/partner/open-source/).

  As part of this collaboration, Datadog provides a dedicated sandbox account that we use for automated integration and acceptance testing. This contribution allows us to continuously validate changes against a real Datadog environment, improving reliability and reducing the risk of regressions.

  We are grateful to Datadog for supporting our open source ecosystem and helping ensure that infrastructure code for Terraform remains stable and well-tested
